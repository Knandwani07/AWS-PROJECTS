* Create a billing alarm for $25  
* Create a billing alarm for $100  

### You need to answer the following:  

### ***1. How many billing alarms do you get for free?***  

You can create up to **10 billing alarms** for free as part of the AWS Free Tier.  

### ***2. When a billing alarm is triggered, how will you know?***  

When a billing alarm is triggered, you will receive a notification via **Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)**. This can be configured to send alerts through **email, SMS, or other endpoints**.  

### ***3. What is the difference between a billing alarm and a CloudWatch alarm?***  

* **Billing Alarm:**  
  Monitors your **AWS account’s estimated charges**. It triggers when your charges exceed a specified threshold. Billing alarms are based on **billing data** and are used to **help manage and control costs**.  

* **CloudWatch Alarm:**  
  Monitors **various AWS resource metrics**, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and custom metrics. These alarms can trigger actions like **sending notifications or automatically scaling resources** based on defined thresholds.
